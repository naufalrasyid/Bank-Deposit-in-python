# Bank-Deposit-in-python
modelling using regression and classification using several types of algorithms

# Project Description
In my recent project, I performed predictive modelling on bank data sets, using a range of regression and classification algorithms. Notably, I employed Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and others to predict customer behaviour, particularly whether a customer will make a deposit or not. This project demonstrates my expertise in developing and refining predictive models for practical settings, exemplifying a data-oriented strategy for decision-making in the banking industry.
